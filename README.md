# El Rinc√≥n de Alemania 

Hi, this is my final project for Coderhouse Web Development Course. 

I created this using Balsamiq, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. 

### Objective:
- Create a responsive website that has five sections using the tools learned in the course.
### Prototype:
The prototype for this project was made using Balsamiq.

### Conclusions: 

Carrying out this project was an enriching experience. 
Thanks to this, I was able to practice and deepen my knowledge of front-end development.

I hope to continue creating and building projects.
